Installation

The MARS Assembly SimulatorLinks to an external site. (version 4.5) is our simulator of choice for the course project. This application is only packaged as a jar file, and so an installation of the Java runtime is required. Once you have a Java Runtime Environment (or Java Development Kit) installed, you should be able to open the Mars4_5.jar file.
